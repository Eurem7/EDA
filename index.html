<h3>Review</h3>

<h4> <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>The Titanic dataset provides passenger information, including socio-economic status, ticket details, and survival status. This EDA aims to uncover patterns, handle missing values, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful features for further modeling.
<p>
<h3>2. Data Overview</h3><p>
The dataset consists of 418 records and 12 columns, spanning categorical (e.g., Sex, Embarked),numerical (e.g., Age, Fare), and mixed-type features (Cabin, Ticket). Key observations include:<br> <p>
‚Ä¢	Missing values: Age (~20%), Fare (1 entry), and Cabin (77%) have null values.<br> <p>
‚Ä¢	Data types: Some categorical variables require encoding for machine learning compatibility.<br> <p>
‚Ä¢	Potential feature interactions: Family relationships (SibSp, Parch) and passenger class (Pclass) likely impact survival rates.<br> <p>

<h3>3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing</h3><p>
To ensure robust analysis, the following steps were taken:<p>
~ Missing Values:<p>
‚Ä¢	Age was imputed using the median (resistant to outliers).<p>
‚Ä¢	Fare was imputed using the median to maintain data consistency.<p>
‚Ä¢	Cabin was dropped due to excessive missing data (~77%).<p>
 ~Categorical Encoding:<p>
‚Ä¢	Sex and Embarked were transformed using Label Encoding.<p>
‚Ä¢	Embarked missing values were replaced with the most frequent category (mode).<p>
 ~ Feature Engineering:<p>
‚Ä¢	Title Extraction: Titles (Mr., Mrs., Miss., etc.) were extracted from names to explore their impact on survival.<p>
‚Ä¢	Family Size: A new feature FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1 was created to analyze family influence.<p>

<h3>4. Univariate & Bivariate Analysis</h3>
üìä Distributions & Summary Statistics<p>
‚Ä¢	Age: Skewed right, with a concentration around 30 years.<p>
‚Ä¢	Fare: Highly right-skewed, with a few expensive tickets acting as outliers.<p></p>
‚Ä¢	Pclass: Clear segmentation, with most passengers in 3rd class.<p></p>
üìà Survival Trends<p></p>
‚Ä¢	Sex: Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.<p></p>
‚Ä¢	Pclass: 1st-class passengers had the highest survival probability.<p></p>
‚Ä¢	Fare & Survival: Higher fares were correlated with increased survival chances.<p></p>
üìâ Outlier Detection & Handling<p></p>
‚Ä¢	Outliers in Fare and Age were detected using Z-score analysis.<p></p>
‚Ä¢	Extreme outliers (>3 standard deviations) were removed to prevent model bias.<p></p>

5. Key Insights & Recommendations<p></p>
üîç Insights:<p></p>
1.	Women and children were prioritized during the evacuation, evident from survival rates.<p></p>
2.	Passenger class strongly influenced survival, reinforcing the socioeconomic disparities aboard.<p></p>
3.	Family size has a non-linear impact‚Äîtoo large or too small families had lower survival chances.<p></p>
4.	Title extraction provides a new, meaningful categorical variable that correlates with social status and survival.<p></p>
